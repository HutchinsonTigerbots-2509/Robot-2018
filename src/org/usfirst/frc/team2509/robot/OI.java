	 * CREATING BUTTONS -

	 * You create one by telling it which joystick it's on and which button number it is.
	 * <p>Joystick stick = new Joystick(port);
	 * <p>Button button = new JoystickButton(stick, buttonNumber);
	 * <p>There are a few additional built in buttons you can use. Additionally,
	 * by subclassing Button you can create custom triggers and bind those to
	 * commands the same as any other Button.
	 * 
	 * <p>TRIGGERING COMMANDS WITH BUTTONS
	 * <p>Once you have a button, it's trivial to bind it to a button in one of three ways:
	 * <p>Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command until 
	 * it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
	 * <p>button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());
	 * <p>Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once the 
	 * button is released.
	 * <p>button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());
	 * <p>Start the command when the button is released and let it run the command until 
	 * it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
	 * <p>button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());
